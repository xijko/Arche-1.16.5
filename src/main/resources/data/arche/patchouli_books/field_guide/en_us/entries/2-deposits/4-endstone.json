Their world lies at the edge of the epoch, ruled by a draconic dynasty, and on an eternal campaign to catalogue the ruins of time and space. The subjects of her majesty's divine destiny wander the bleached, barren kingdom in anticipation of the breaching emptiness, with devotion that can only be described as hopelessly instinctual."
