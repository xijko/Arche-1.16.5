      "text": "At the end of all things, the pieces come together, and the threads of life and civilization are laid plain. A society of heralds with eyes in the end of reality record their observations in revelatory detail. Their world lies at the edge of the epoch, ruled by a draconic dynasty on an eternal campaign to catalogue the ruins of time and space. The subjects of her divine destiny wander the bleached, barren kingdom in anticipation of the breaching emptiness, with focus that can be described as both devout and instinctual."
