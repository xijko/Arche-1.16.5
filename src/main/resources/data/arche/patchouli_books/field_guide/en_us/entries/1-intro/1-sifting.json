Sifting will (usually) yield materials - some of which you could expect to find in the world nearby through other means, others which are only available to enterprising archaeologists. Let's create a basic sieve, just to get started - it's crude, but will do for sediment."

Otherwise, consider saving up the materials you find this way for later..."
